                    But seriously, I come from a small country town in North Carolina called Johnsonville. It's
                    locacted in between Sanford
                    and Fayetteville. I have well over a decade of retail/grocery store experience with 
                    a little management experience sprinkled in there as well. 

                    This is a huge industry change for me but 
                    I'm not afraid to work my way from the bottom to get to where I want to be.
                    I'm a creative person and I love watching my visions come to life.

                    I'm currently engaged to my beautiful fiance Niara and we're set to get married this September.
                    My biggest hobbies in my down time are music production and watching anime.

                    I'm currently enrolled at the University of Charlotte and taking their coding bootcamp. I'm
                    finally
                    taking the first steps in becoming a software engineer.
